                Hi there!
                I hear you’re looking into adopting a mod that had been sadly orphaned.
                Maybe the creator retired, or maybe they’ve taken an extended hiatus and one (or more) of their mods broke, and you’re stepping up.
                Thanks!

                If this is your first time adopting a mod, there are a few things you’ll want to consider as an upstanding member of the TS4 modding community.
                For example:

        <MudItem xs="12">
            <MudMarkdown Value="@bulletListMarkdown" />
        </MudItem>
        <MudItem xs="12">
            <MudTextM3>
                If you’re unsure, you might want to ask some other modders for advice.
                A good place to do that is <MudLink Href="https://discord.com/invite/creator-musings-605863047654801428" Target="_blank">the Creator Musings Discord server</MudLink>.
