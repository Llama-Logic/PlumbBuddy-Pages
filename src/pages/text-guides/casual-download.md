### [Downloading](https://plumbbuddy.app/download)

The easiest way to install the PlumbBuddy app is from [the download page](https://plumbbuddy.app/download). There, the website will make a pretty good guess about which version you need, but you can pick another version if it guesses wrong. The one at the top is the one you'll want most of the time.

If you're on Windows, you want the .msix file with the Windows symbol, and if you're on a Mac, you want the .zip file with the 'mac os' symbol. Click on the one that's right for you and download it.

If for any reason the website download link isn't working for you, you can also download PlumbBuddy from GitHub. You can get the latest version [here](https://github.com/Llama-Logic/PlumbBuddy/releases/latest). Scroll to the bottom of the page, and download the .msix file if you're on Windowsor the .zip file if you're on Mac.
