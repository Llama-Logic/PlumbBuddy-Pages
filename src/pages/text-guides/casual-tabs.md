### [Mod Health](https://plumbbuddy.app/features/mod-health)

Once you have PlumbBuddy set up and some mods with manifests installed, PlumbBuddy will get to work helping you keep your game running as smoothly as possible.

You might get some alerts right away. That’s fine. PlumbBuddy will do its best to tell you what you need to do. You might be told you have a .zip file in your mods folder, where it’s not supposed to be, or that you have a missing requirement for a mod. You might get a recommendation to download a specific mod that will help you. Just read what it says, and decide what you want to do. Or you might have no alerts at all.

If you want to learn more about the scans themselves, go to the [What the Scans Tell You](https://plumbbuddy.app/text-guides/scans) guide.

### [Catalog](https://plumbbuddy.app/features/catalog)

If you go to the Catalog tab, you’ll see all of the mods you currently have installed that have manifests. For each one, if the information is included in the manifest, you may see:

* The mod name
* A short description
* The download URL for the mod
* The name(s) of the creator(s)
* An ask for help button to seek help with the mod, either to go to a support avenue specified by the creator or to go to a general support discord server
* Packs the mod requires (in green on the default theme)
* Packs the mod cannot be used with (in red on the default theme)
* The files that are in the mod
* Any mods that the mod requires, as long as they have manifests themselves (dependencies)
* Any mods that require the mod, as long as they have manifests themselves (dependants)

You can click buttons on the right of the file names or dependency/dependant to look at that file or that mod.

You can search the whole catalogue on the top right of the catalogue, and you can search the mod itself, if you need to, to the right side of the screen.
