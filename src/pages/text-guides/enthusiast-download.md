### [Downloading](https://plumbbuddy.app/download)

The easiest way to install the PlumbBuddy app is from [the download page](https://plumbbuddy.app/download). There, the website will make a pretty good guess about which version you need, but you can pick another version if it guesses wrong. The one at the top is the one you'll want most of the time.

If you're on a non-ARM Windows computer, you want `PlumbBuddy_1.5.37_x64.msix`. If you're on an ARM Windows computer, you want can use either of the .msix files, but `PlumbBuddy_1.5.37_arm64.msix` may give increased performance. If you aren't sure if you have an ARM computer, use the regular non-ARM file, unless the PlumbBuddy site detects that you are using an ARM computer. If you're on a Mac, you want `PlumbBuddy_1.5.37.zip`. Click on the one that's right for you and download it.

If for any reason the website download link isn't working for you, you can also download PlumbBuddy from GitHub. You can get the latest version [here](https://github.com/Llama-Logic/PlumbBuddy/releases/latest). Scroll to the bottom of the page, and download the correct file for you.

### Installing on Windows

Once it's finished downloading, click on the file in your browser's downloads or find where it downloaded and double click it. A new window will open. Click on Install and wait for it to finish installing.

Don't unzip/extract the .msix file. It's an archive file, but it only functions as a .msix file, not as loose files. Just install it as it is.
