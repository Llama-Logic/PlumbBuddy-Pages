When you installed PlumbBuddy for the first time, you were given the option to turn off a warning if you don't have ModGuard in your mods folder and an alert that you have an error file, and to turn on warnings if you don't have the mods Better Exceptions by Twisted Mexi and/or MC Command Center by Deaderpool installed. 

For Casual Players, other scans are on by default. You can turn them off (or on) in PlumbBuddy settings, accessed through the menu on the left, or by clicking 'Stop Telling Me' when Mod Health finds something to tell you about.

In the Mod Health section of PlumbBuddy settings, there are four categories:

1. [In The Sims 4 game options...](#in-the-sims-4-game-options)
    * For things about the game itself
2. [Inside your Mods Folder, I find...](#inside-your-mods-folder-i-find)
    * For things to do with the health of your mods folder
3. [Inside your Installation and Mods Folders, I DO NOT find...](#inside-your-installation-and-mods-folders-i-do-not-find)
    * For things that you don't have that you might need or want
4. [Mod file analysis suggests...](#mod-file-analysis-suggests)
    * For things that PlumbBuddy has found about your mods

Each of these sections has multiple scans that you can turn off or on if you find them useful. Read below to find out what these scan check for and what you can do when they alert you to a potential problem.

### In The Sims 4 game options...

1. **…Mods are disabled even though you have .package files**

===========================================================

*What it means:*

*What you can do:*

* PlumbBuddy will offer to enable this game option for you.

2. **…Script mods are disabled even though you have .ts4script files**

*What it means:*

* You have script mods installed (meaning mods that contain files that have the .ts4script file type)
* Script mods are turned off in your game settings, so the game does not know they exist.

*What you can do:*

* PlumbBuddy will offer to enable this game option for you.

*Extra info:*

* If you have mods turned on but not script mods, the game will try to load half a mod. This will result in a broken mod, which can cause a wide range of issues, up to the game not loading or being extremely broken if it does.
* Script mods turned off by default by the game, so if you’ve never turned them on, they will be off.
* They are also turned off after many game patches and need to be turned back on.

3. **…Show At Startup is enabled in View Custom Content**

*What it means:*

* The list of mods that shows when you start the game in enabled in your game settings, which will result in the game taking longer to load.

*What you can do:*

* PlumbBuddy will offer to disable this game option for you.

*Extra info:*

* When you start the game, by default, the game will show you a list of all mods and custom content that you have installed.
* This can be the cause of very long loading times, and PlumbBuddy will offer to turn this game option off for you to reduce that loading time.
* This can mean the difference between a loading time of up to several hours and a loading time counted in minutes.
